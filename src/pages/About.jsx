              Hi, I'm Nikhil 👋 [an Ex-BCA Student from IGNOU]
            </h2>
            <p>
              When I started my journey with IGNOU, I faced the same struggles
              that many of us do:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-outside list-disc pl-4">
              <li>
                No clear place to find previous year question papers,
                assignments, or solutions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Guidelines and notifications scattered across multiple sites.
              </li>
              <li>A lack of organized study materials and proper guidance.</li>
              <li>
                Feeling lost while trying to figure out the right path for
                exams, projects, and submissions.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Like many students, I spent hours searching for reliable resources
              but often ended up confused and frustrated. That’s when I decided
              — why not build something that solves these problems once and for
              all?
            </p>
            <p>
              This platform is the result of that thought. My goal is to create
              a clean, minimal, and organized space where every IGNOU BCA
              student can find:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-outside list-disc pl-4">
              <li>📚 Previous year question papers (with solutions)</li>
              <li>📝 Assignments and study materials</li>
              <li>🔗 Important links and official guidelines</li>
              <li>📢 Updates and notifications in one place</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I want this website to be the place I wish I had when I started my
              BCA journey — a space that saves time, reduces confusion, and
              makes learning easier for every IGNOU BCA student.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is not just a project for marks, it’s something built from my
              own challenges and experiences, with the hope that it will guide
              and support others walking the same path.
            </p>
            <p>
              Together, we can make the BCA journey smoother and more
              meaningful. 🚀
            </p>
