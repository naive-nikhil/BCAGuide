        Hi, I'm Nikhil ðŸ‘‹ [an Ex-BCA Student from IGNOU]
      </h2>
      <p>
        When I started my journey with IGNOU, I faced the same struggles that
        many of us do:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-outside list-disc pl-4">
        <li>
          No clear place to find previous year question papers, assignments, or
          solutions.
        </li>
        <li>Guidelines and notifications scattered across multiple sites.</li>
        <li>A lack of organized study materials and proper guidance.</li>
        <li>
          Feeling lost while trying to figure out the right path for exams,
          projects, and submissions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Like many students, I spent hours searching for reliable resources but
        often ended up confused and frustrated. Thatâ€™s when I decided â€” why not
        build something that solves these problems once and for all?
      </p>
      <p>
        This platform is the result of that thought. My goal is to create a
        clean, minimal, and organized space where every IGNOU BCA student can
        find:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-outside list-disc pl-4">
        <li>Previous year question papers (with solutions)</li>
        <li>Assignments and study materials</li>
        <li>Important links and official guidelines</li>
        <li>Updates and notifications in one place</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I want this website to be the place I wish I had when I started my BCA
        journey â€” a space that saves time, reduces confusion, and makes learning
        easier for every IGNOU BCA student.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not just a project for marks, itâ€™s something built from my own
        challenges and experiences, with the hope that it will guide and support
        others walking the same path.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, we can make the BCA journey smoother and more meaningful. ðŸš€
      </p>
